Dependencies: gnome-tweaks, extension manager, Tela Circle red-dark icons (uploaded the link in reddit), Nord Theme (uploaded the link in the reddit).

Gnome Extensions installed: User Themes, ArcMenu, Blur my Shell, Dash to Dock for Cosmic, Focus, Just Perfection, clipboard indicator, compiz alike magic lamp effect.

Take a look at the screenshots I uploaded in the "Extensions" folder in order to know how I configured them. Just read the title of each image to know which extension is being customized.

Install The Tela-Circle-red-dark icon pack and the Nord Theme. What I did was to just install all Tela-circle icon packs to have access to other colors as well, that's when I saw that the red one is installed, I couldnt install the red icon theme alone, so please bear that in mind.

Now u can launch gnome-tweaks and btw I took a screenshot of how I configured it as well. I titled it Gnome-tweaks.png.

Obviously I use the defaut Gnome Terminal. U can also take a look at how I customized it if u go to the "Terminal" Folder, I put 2 screenshots there...
